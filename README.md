# ECG QRS Detection Algorithm

Welcome to the **QRS Detection** repository. This Python program is meticulously designed to process ECG signals, aiming to identify QRS complexes, vital indicators of heart activity. By leveraging a sequence of sophisticated signal processing techniques, the program extracts valuable QRS information from potentially noisy ECG data.

## Signal Processing Workflow

The algorithm's essence resides in its comprehensive signal processing workflow:

- **Filtering:** At the outset, a dual filtering strategy is employed. ECG signals undergo a preliminary low-pass filter stage, effectively eradicating high-frequency noise and interference. Subsequently, a high-pass filter is implemented to eliminate baseline wander. The culmination of these filtering stages through a band-pass filter ensures the preservation of solely heart activity-related components for further analysis.

- **Differentiation:** Following successful filtering, the band-pass signal is subjected to differentiation. This operation reveals segments characterized by significant signal alterations. Such differentiation distinctly illuminates the rapid fluctuations inherent to QRS complexes, facilitating their subsequent pinpointing.

- **QRS Detection:** The program's focal point lies in QRS complex detection, achieved through an intricate interplay of thresholding mechanisms. The threshold at any given instance is intelligently computed, factoring in both the signal value of previously identified QRS complexes and noise peaks. This adaptive thresholding approach ensures the precise identification of QRS complexes, even amid varying signal amplitudes and noise fluctuations.

## Usage and Contributions
